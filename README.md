Car Price Prediction Model
The Car Price Prediction Model is a machine learning-based system that estimates the price of a car based on various features like brand, model, year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and condition. It uses historical car sales data to train a regression model, typically Linear Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost.

Key Features:
âœ… Data Collection â€“ Uses datasets from car listings and sales history.
âœ… Feature Engineering â€“ Considers factors like age, depreciation, and market trends.
âœ… Model Training â€“ Uses machine learning algorithms to predict prices.
âœ… User Input â€“ Allows users to enter car details and get an estimated price.

This model is widely used in car dealerships, resale platforms, and online marketplaces to assist buyers and sellers in determining fair market value. ðŸš—ðŸ’°
